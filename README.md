# ml-classification-practice
I downloaded a high votes dataset named Mobile Price Classification on Kaggle. It might be Ill-documented, Ill-maintained, and suitable for learning. So, I use this dataset to implement the practice on classification. I went through all the procedures, including data preprocessing, model implementation, and model evaluation. I didnâ€™t implement testing because there is no point in testing in this task. Besides KNN and Logistic Regression, I also implement Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and SVC. Experiments show that the Logistic Regression Model is the best model to tackle this task, and KNN is the worst.
